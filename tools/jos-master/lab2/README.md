Part 1: Physical Page Management
===
Exercise 1
---
```
Exercise 1. In the file kern/pmap.c, you must implement code for the following functions (probably in the order given).

boot_alloc()
mem_init() (only up to the call to check_page_free_list(1))
page_init()
page_alloc()
page_free()

check_page_free_list() and check_page_alloc() test your physical page allocator. You should boot JOS and see whether check_page_alloc() reports success. Fix your code so that it passes. You may find it helpful to add your own assert()s to verify that your assumptions are correct.
```
boot_alloc:
```c
	// ROUNDUP to make sure nextfree is kept aligned
	// to a multiple of PGSIZE
	cprintf("boot_alloc memory at %x\n", nextfree);
	cprintf("Next memory at %x\n", ROUNDUP((char *) (nextfree+n), PGSIZE));
	if (n != 0) {
		char *next = nextfree;
		nextfree = ROUNDUP((char *) (nextfree+n), PGSIZE);
		return next;
	} else return nextfree;
```
page_init:

>Q: Then extended memory [EXTPHYSMEM, ...).
	Some of it is in use, some is free. Where is the kernel
	in physical memory?  Which pages are already in use for
	page tables and other data structures?

Memory after `(int)ROUNDUP(((char*)pages) + (sizeof(struct PageInfo) * npages) - 0xf0000000, PGSIZE)/PGSIZE;` is free.
```
void
page_init(void)
{
	size_t i;
	for (i = 1; i < npages_basemem; i++) {
		pages[i].pp_ref = 0;
		pages[i].pp_link = page_free_list;
		page_free_list = &pages[i];
	}
	int med = (int)ROUNDUP(((char*)pages) + (sizeof(struct PageInfo) * npages) - 0xf0000000, PGSIZE)/PGSIZE;
	cprintf("%d\n", ((char*)pages) + (sizeof(struct PageInfo) * npages));
	cprintf("med=%d\n", med);
	for (i = med; i < npages; i++) {
		pages[i].pp_ref = 0;
		pages[i].pp_link = page_free_list;
		page_free_list = &pages[i];
	}
}
```

page_alloc:
```c
struct PageInfo *
page_alloc(int alloc_flags)
{
	if (page_free_list) {
		struct PageInfo *ret = page_free_list;
		page_free_list = page_free_list->pp_link;
		if (alloc_flags & ALLOC_ZERO) 
			memset(page2kva(ret), 0, PGSIZE);
		return ret;
	}
	return NULL;
}
```

page_free:
```c
void
page_free(struct PageInfo *pp)
{
	pp->pp_link = page_free_list;
	page_free_list = pp;
}
```

```

Part 2: Virtual Memory
===

```
Question:
Assuming that the following JOS kernel code is correct, what type should variable x have, uintptr_t or physaddr_t?
	mystery_t x;
	char* value = return_a_pointer();
	*value = 10;
	x = (mystery_t) value;
```
Answer: uintptr_t, because va is used in applications.

The following code in `pmap.c` is very informative:
```c
static physaddr_t
check_va2pa(pde_t *pgdir, uintptr_t va)
{
	pte_t *p;

	pgdir = &pgdir[PDX(va)];
	if (!(*pgdir & PTE_P))
		return ~0;
	p = (pte_t*) KADDR(PTE_ADDR(*pgdir));
	if (!(p[PTX(va)] & PTE_P))
		return ~0;
	return PTE_ADDR(p[PTX(va)]);
}
```

Exercise 4
---
```
In the file kern/pmap.c, you must implement code for the following functions.

        pgdir_walk()
        boot_map_region()
        page_lookup()
        page_remove()
        page_insert()
	
check_page(), called from mem_init(), tests your page table management routines. You should make sure it reports success before proceeding.
```
pgdr_walk, the comments is between codes:
```c
pte_t *
pgdir_walk(pde_t *pgdir, const void *va, int create)
{
	int dindex = PDX(va), tindex = PTX(va);
	//dir index, table index
	if (!(pgdir[dindex] & PTE_P)) {	//if pde not exist
		if (create) {
			struct PageInfo *pg = page_alloc(ALLOC_ZERO);	//alloc a zero page
			if (!pg) return NULL;	//allocation fails
			pg->pp_ref++;
			pgdir[dindex] = page2pa(pg) | PTE_P | PTE_U | PTE_W;	
			//we should use PTE_U and PTE_W to pass checkings
		} else return NULL;
	}
	pte_t *p = KADDR(PTE_ADDR(pgdir[dindex]));

	//THESE CODE COMMENTED IS NOT NEEDED 
	// if (!(p[tindex] & PTE_P))	//if pte not exist
	// 	if (create) {
	// 		struct PageInfo *pg = page_alloc(ALLOC_ZERO);	//alloc a zero page
	// 		pg->pp_ref++;
	// 		p[tindex] = page2pa(pg) | PTE_P;
	// 	} else return NULL;

	return p+tindex;
}
```
boot_map_region, the comments is between codes:
```c
static void
boot_map_region(pde_t *pgdir, uintptr_t va, size_t size, physaddr_t pa, int perm)
{
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < size/PGSIZE; ++i, va += PGSIZE, pa += PGSIZE) {
		pte_t *pte = pgdir_walk(pgdir, (void *) va, 1);	//create
		if (!pte) panic("boot_map_region panic, out of memory");
		*pte = pa | perm | PTE_P;
	}
}
```
page_lookup, the comments is between codes:
```c
struct PageInfo *
page_lookup(pde_t *pgdir, void *va, pte_t **pte_store)
{
	pte_t *pte = pgdir_walk(pgdir, va, 0);	//not create
	if (!pte || !(*pte & PTE_P)) return NULL;	//page not found
	if (pte_store)
		*pte_store = pte;	//found and set
	return pa2page(PTE_ADDR(*pte));		
}
```
page_remove, the comments is between codes:
```c
void
page_remove(pde_t *pgdir, void *va)
{
	pte_t *pte;
	struct PageInfo *pg = page_lookup(pgdir, va, &pte);
	if (!pg || !(*pte & PTE_P)) return;	//page not exist
//   - The ref count on the physical page should decrement.
//   - The physical page should be freed if the refcount reaches 0.
	page_decref(pg);
//   - The pg table entry corresponding to 'va' should be set to 0.
	*pte = 0;
//   - The TLB must be invalidated if you remove an entry from
//     the page table.
	tlb_invalidate(pgdir, va);
}
```
page_insert, be aware of how corner-case is avoided, the comments is between codes:
```c
int
page_insert(pde_t *pgdir, struct PageInfo *pp, void *va, int perm)
{
	pte_t *pte = pgdir_walk(pgdir, va, 1);	//create on demand
	if (!pte) 	//page table not allocated
		return -E_NO_MEM;	
	//increase ref count beforehand to avoid the corner case that pp is freed before it is inserted.
	pp->pp_ref++;	
	if (*pte & PTE_P) 	//page colides, tle is invalidated in page_remove
		page_remove(pgdir, va);
	*pte = page2pa(pp) | perm | PTE_P;
	return 0;
}
```


Part 3: Kernel Address Space
===
Exercise 5.
---
```
Fill in the missing code in mem_init() after the call to check_page().
```
UPAGES:
```c
	boot_map_region(kern_pgdir, 
		UPAGES, 
		PTSIZE, 
		PADDR(pages), 
		PTE_U);
```
BOOTSTACK:
```c
	boot_map_region(kern_pgdir, 
		KSTACKTOP-KSTKSIZE, 
		KSTKSIZE, 
		PADDR(bootstack), 
		PTE_W);
```
KERNBASE, be aware that -KERNBASE is 0x10000000 positive:
```
	boot_map_region(kern_pgdir, 
		KERNBASE, 
		-KERNBASE, 
		0, 
		PTE_W);
```

Questions
---
>What entries (rows) in the page directory have been filled in at this point? What addresses do they map and where do they point? 

Here's my answer:
![map](assets/map.jpg)

>We have placed the kernel and user environment in the same address space. Why will user programs not be able to read or write the kernel's memory? What specific mechanisms protect the kernel memory?

Because PTE_U is not enabled.

>What is the maximum amount of physical memory that this operating system can support? Why?

2G, becuase the maximum size of UPAGES is 4MB, `sizeof(struct PageInfo))=8`Byte, 
so we can have at most `4MB/8B=512K` pages,
the size of one page is 4KB, so we can have at most `4MB/8B*4KB)=2GB` physical memory.

>How much space overhead is there for managing memory, if we actually had the maximum amount of physical memory? How is this overhead broken down?

We need 4MB `PageInfo`s to manage memory plus 2MB for Page Table
plus 4KB for Page Directory if we have 2GB physical memory.
Total:6MB+4KB

>Revisit the page table setup in kern/entry.S and kern/entrypgdir.c. Immediately after we turn on paging, EIP is still a low number (a little over 1MB). At what point do we transition to running at an EIP above KERNBASE? What makes it possible for us to continue executing at a low EIP between when we enable paging and when we begin running at an EIP above KERNBASE? Why is this transition necessary?

After `jmp *%eax` finished. It is possible because `entry_pgdir` also maps va [0, 4M) to pa [0, 4M), it's necessary because later a `kern_pgdir` will be loaded and va [0, 4M) will be abandoned.

Challenges
===

Challenge
---
```
Challenge! We consumed many physical pages to hold the page tables for the KERNBASE mapping. Do a more space-efficient job using the PTE_PS ("Page Size") bit in the page directory entries. This bit was not supported in the original 80386, but is supported on more recent x86 processors. You will therefore have to refer to Volume 3 of the current Intel manuals. Make sure you design the kernel to use this optimization only on processors that support it!
```
Ouch! It is too difficult to me to reimplement the kernel...

Challenge
---
```
Challenge! Extend the JOS kernel monitor with commands to:

Display in a useful and easy-to-read format all of the physical page mappings (or lack thereof) that apply to a particular range of virtual/linear addresses in the currently active address space. For example, you might enter 'showmappings 0x3000 0x5000' to display the physical page mappings and corresponding permission bits that apply to the pages at virtual addresses 0x3000, 0x4000, and 0x5000.
Explicitly set, clear, or change the permissions of any mapping in the current address space.
Dump the contents of a range of memory given either a virtual or physical address range. Be sure the dump code behaves correctly when the range extends across page boundaries!
Do anything else that you think might be useful later for debugging the kernel. (There's a good chance it will be!)
```

First, I need a function to translate string to address:
```c
uint32_t xtoi(char* buf) {
	uint32_t res = 0;
	buf += 2; //0x...
	while (*buf) { 
		if (*buf >= 'a') *buf = *buf-'a'+'0'+10;//aha
		res = res*16 + *buf - '0';
		++buf;
	}
	return res;
}
```
and a function that beautifully prints pte_t:
```c
void pprint(pte_t *pte) {
	cprintf("PTE_P: %x, PTE_W: %x, PTE_U: %x\n", 
		*pte&PTE_P, *pte&PTE_W, *pte&PTE_U);
}
```

Here's my `showmappings`:
```c
int
showmappings(int argc, char **argv, struct Trapframe *tf)
{
	if (argc == 1) {
		cprintf("Usage: showmappings 0xbegin_addr 0xend_addr\n");
		return 0;
	}
	uint32_t begin = xtoi(argv[1]), end = xtoi(argv[2]);
	cprintf("begin: %x, end: %x\n", begin, end);
	for (; begin <= end; begin += PGSIZE) {
		pte_t *pte = pgdir_walk(kern_pgdir, (void *) begin, 1);	//create
		if (!pte) panic("boot_map_region panic, out of memory");
		if (*pte & PTE_P) {
			cprintf("page %x with ", begin);
			pprint(pte);
		} else cprintf("page not exist: %x\n", begin);
	}
	return 0;
}
```

Challenge
---
```
Challenge! Write up an outline of how a kernel could be designed to allow user environments unrestricted use of the full 4GB virtual and linear address space. Hint: the technique is sometimes known as "follow the bouncing kernel." In your design, be sure to address exactly what has to happen when the processor transitions between kernel and user modes, and how the kernel would accomplish such transitions. Also describe how the kernel would access physical memory and I/O devices in this scheme, and how the kernel would access a user environment's virtual address space during system calls and the like. Finally, think about and describe the advantages and disadvantages of such a scheme in terms of flexibility, performance, kernel complexity, and other factors you can think of.
```
Well, I have no idea how to do it, maybe I'll know later.

Challenge
---
```
Challenge! Since our JOS kernel's memory management system only allocates and frees memory on page granularity, we do not have anything comparable to a general-purpose malloc/free facility that we can use within the kernel. This could be a problem if we want to support certain types of I/O devices that require physically contiguous buffers larger than 4KB in size, or if we want user-level environments, and not just the kernel, to be able to allocate and map 4MB superpages for maximum processor efficiency. (See the earlier challenge problem about PTE_PS.)
Generalize the kernel's memory allocation system to support pages of a variety of power-of-two allocation unit sizes from 4KB up to some reasonable maximum of your choice. Be sure you have some way to divide larger allocation units into smaller ones on demand, and to coalesce multiple small allocation units back into larger units when possible. Think about the issues that might arise in such a system.
```
The buddy system is exactly what you want, see `malloc lab` in `Introduction to Computer Systems`.

This completes the lab.
