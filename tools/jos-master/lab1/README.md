Installing gcc in Mac OS X
---------------------
Use brew to install glib, gmp, mpfr, libmpc before configuring gcc:
```shell
brew install glib
brew install gmp
brew install mpfr
brew install libmpc
```

Build gcc outside of the source tree:
```shell
mkdir build 
cd build
../configure --target=i386-jos-elf --disable-nls --without-headers --with-newlib --disable-threads --disable-shared --disable-libmudflap --disable-libssp
```

Installing qemu 
---

```shell
./configure --target-list="i386-softmmu" --disable-kvm --disable-sdl
make
make install
```

Configuring JOS
---
Append the following line to `conf/env.mk`: 
```
QEMU=/usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64
```

Then type `make` and `make qemu`

Struggling with gdb
---
Type `gdb` then `boot` is loaded but `kernel` can't be recognized

```shell
>> gdb
.gdbinit:30: Error in sourced command file:
"lab/obj/kern/kernel": can't read symbols: File format not recognized.
```

Check the `.gdbinit` and get:
> If this fails, it's probably because your GDB doesn't support ELF.
> Look at the tools page at
>  http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2009/tools.html
> for instructions on building GDB with ELF support.

Goto `/usr/local/bin` and find `i386-jos-elf-gdb` 
Use `i386-jos-elf-gdb` rather than `gdb`:

```shell
$ i386-jos-elf-gdb

Exercise 3
---

>Q: At what point does the processor start executing 32-bit code? What exactly causes the switch from 16- to 32-bit mode?

The `ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg` causes the switch from 16- to 32-bit mode in the `boot.S`:
```assembly
  lgdt    gdtdesc
  movl    %cr0, %eax
  orl     $CR0_PE_ON, %eax
  movl    %eax, %cr0
  ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg
```


>Q: What is the last instruction of the boot loader executed

In `main.c`, it's
```c
  ((void (*)(void)) (ELFHDR->e_entry))();
```
In `boot.asm`, it's
```asm
    7d63: ff 15 18 00 01 00     call   *0x10018
```

>Q: and what is the first instruction of the kernel it just loaded?
It's:
```
f010000c: 66 c7 05 72 04 00 00  movw   $0x1234,0x472
```

>Q: Where is the first instruction of the kernel?

Since the last instruction the boot loader executed is 
`call *0x10018`, the first instruction of the kernel should be at `*0x10018`.
Examine `*0x10018` using `gdb`:
```
(gdb) x/1x 0x10018
0x10018:  0x0010000c
```
so the first instruction of the kernel is at `0x0010000c`


>Q: How does the boot loader decide how many sectors it must read in order to fetch the entire kernel from disk? Where does it find this information?

The boot loader reads the number the `program header`s in the `ELF header` and loads them all:
```c
  ph = (struct Proghdr *) ((uint8_t *) ELFHDR + ELFHDR->e_phoff);
  eph = ph + ELFHDR->e_phnum;
  for (; ph < eph; ph++)
    readseg(ph->p_pa, ph->p_memsz, ph->p_offset);
```

Exercise 5.

So what's the difference between link address and load address?
See [Linking vs loading](http://www.iecc.com/linker/linker01.html).

>Q: Trace through the first few instructions of the boot loader again and identify the first instruction that would "break" or otherwise do the wrong thing if you were to get the boot loader's link address wrong. 

Obviously the `ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg` is the first instruction that breaks:
```asm
Right:
[   0:7c2d] 0x7c2d: ljmp   $0x8,$0x7c32
The target architecture is assumed to be i386
0x7c32: mov    $0x10,%ax
0x7c36: mov    %eax,%ds
0x7c38: mov    %eax,%es
0x7c3a: mov    %eax,%fs
``` 
```asm
Wrong:
[   0:7c2d] 0x7c2d: ljmp   $0x8,$0x7c36
[f000:e05b] 0xfe05b:  cmpl   $0x0,%cs:0x66d4
[f000:e062] 0xfe062:  jne    0xfd3da
[f000:d3da] 0xfd3da:  cli
[f000:d3db] 0xfd3db:  cld 
```

Exercise 6

>Q: Examine the 8 words of memory at 0x00100000 at the point the BIOS enters the boot loader

They are all zeros.

>Q: and then again at the point the boot loader enters the kernel

They are the first few instructions of the kernel:

```

>Q: What is the first instruction after the new mapping is established that would fail to work properly if the mapping weren't in place? 

`jmp *%eax` would fail because `0xf010002c` is outside of RAM
```shell
  movl  %eax, %cr3
  # Turn on paging.
  movl  %cr0, %eax
  orl $(CR0_PE|CR0_PG|CR0_WP), %eax
  # movl  %eax, %cr0

  # Now paging is enabled, but we're still running at a low EIP
  # (why is this okay?).  Jump up above KERNBASE before entering
  # C code.
  mov $relocated, %eax
  jmp *%eax
relocated:

  # Clear the frame pointer register (EBP)
  # so that once we get into debugging C code,
  # stack backtraces will be terminated properly.
  movl  $0x0,%ebp     # nuke frame pointer
```

>Q: We have omitted a small fragment of code - the code necessary to print octal numbers using patterns of the form "%o". Find and fill in this code fragment.

Replace the original code:
```c
    // (unsigned) octal
    case 'o':
      // Replace this with your code.
      putch('X', putdat);
      putch('X', putdat);
      putch('X', putdat);
      break;
```
with:
```c
    case 'o':
      num = getuint(&ap, lflag);
      base = 8;
      goto number;
```

Be able to answer the following questions:

>Q: Explain the interface between printf.c and console.c. Specifically, what function does console.c export? How is this function used by printf.c?

`console.c` exports `cputchar` `getchar` `iscons`, while `cputchar` is used as a parameter when `printf.c` calls `vprintfmt` in `printfmt.c`.

>Q: Explain the following from console.c:
```c
     if (crt_pos >= CRT_SIZE) {
              int i;
              memcpy(crt_buf, crt_buf + CRT_COLS, (CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS) * sizeof(uint16_t));
              for (i = CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS; i < CRT_SIZE; i++)
                      crt_buf[i] = 0x0700 | ' ';
              crt_pos -= CRT_COLS;
      }
```

>Q: For the following questions you might wish to consult the notes for Lecture 2. These notes cover GCC's calling convention on the x86.
Trace the execution of the following code step-by-step:
```c
int x = 1, y = 3, z = 4;
cprintf("x %d, y %x, z %d\n", x, y, z);
```
>In the call to cprintf(), to what does fmt point? To what does ap point?

In the call to cprintf(), `fmt` point to the format string of its arguments, `ap` points to the variable arguments after `fmt`.

>List (in order of execution) each call to cons_putc, va_arg, and vcprintf. For cons_putc, list its argument as well. For va_arg, list what ap points to before and after the call. For vcprintf list the values of its two arguments.

I modified the `monitor.c` to execute these instructions:
```c
void
monitor(struct Trapframe *tf)
{
  char *buf;

  cprintf("Welcome to the JOS kernel monitor!\n");
  cprintf("Type 'help' for a list of commands.\n");
  int x = 1, y = 3, z = 4;//inserted
  cprintf("x %d, y %x, z %d\n", x, y, z);//inserted
```
and by using gdb I got the following information:
```
cprintf (fmt=0xf0101ad2 "x %d, y %x, z %d\n") 
vcprintf (fmt=0xf0101ad2 "x %d, y %x, z %d\n", ap=0xf0115f64 "\001")
cons_putc (c=120)
cons_putc (c=32)
va_arg(*ap, int)
Hardware watchpoint 4: ap
Old value = 0xf0115f64 "\001"
New value = 0xf0115f68 "\003"
cons_putc (c=49)
cons_putc (c=44)
cons_putc (c=32)
cons_putc (c=121)
cons_putc (c=32)
va_arg(*ap, int)
Hardware watchpoint 4: ap
Old value = 0xf0115f68 "\003"
New value = 0xf0115f6c "\004"
cons_putc (c=51)
cons_putc (c=44)
cons_putc (c=32)
cons_putc (c=122)
cons_putc (c=32)
va_arg(*ap, int)
Hardware watchpoint 4: ap
Old value = 0xf0115f6c "\004"
New value = 0xf0115f70 "T\034\020?\214_\021??\027\020??_\021??\027\020?_\021?_\021?" #only its value 0xf0115f70 makes sense
cons_putc (c=52)
cons_putc (c=10)
```


>Q: Run the following code.
```c
    unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
    cprintf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
```
>What is the output? Explain how this output is arrived at in the step-by-step manner of the previous exercise. 

The output is `He110 World`, because `57616=0xe110`, so the first half of output is `He110`, `i=0x00646c72` is treated as a string, so it will be printed as `'r'=(char)0x72` `'l'=(char)0x6c` `'d'=(char)0x64`, and `0x00` is treated as a mark of end of string.

>The output depends on that fact that the x86 is little-endian. If the x86 were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

We will see `He110, Wo` in a big-endian machine, we don't have to change 57616 because only it's numeric value matters when being printed.


>Q: In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
```c
    cprintf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
```
It will be the decimal value of the 4 bytes right above where `3` is placed in the stack.


>Q: Let's say that GCC changed its calling convention so that it pushed arguments on the stack in declaration order, so that the last argument is pushed last. How would you have to change cprintf or its interface so that it would still be possible to pass it a variable number of arguments?

Push an integer after the last argument indicating the number of arguments.

>Q: Enhance the console to allow text to be printed in different colors. The traditional way to do this is to make it interpret ANSI escape sequences embedded in the text strings printed to the console, but you may use any mechanism you like. There is plenty of information on the 6.828 reference page and elsewhere on the web on programming the VGA display hardware. If you're feeling really adventurous, you could try switching the VGA hardware into a graphics mode and making the console draw text onto the graphical frame buffer.

I use a `%m` to indicate a color change with a corresponding `int` to indicate the color, for example
`cprintf("%m%s\n%m%s\n%m%s\n", 0x0100, "blue", 0x0200, "green", 0x0400, "red");`

The `monitor.c` is modified as following for testing:
```c
void
monitor(struct Trapframe *tf)
{
  char *buf;

  cprintf("Welcome to the JOS kernel monitor!\n");
  cprintf("Type 'help' for a list of commands.\n");
  cprintf("%m%s\n%m%s\n%m%s\n", 
    0x0100, "blue", 0x0200, "green", 0x0400, "red");
  ...
}
```
and it prints:
![ch1](assets/ch1.png)

A header file `csa.h` is added in the `inc/` folder, it defines a global var `csa`.
In the `console.c`, `cga_putc` was modified as following:
```c
static void
cga_putc(int c)
{
  // if no attribute given, then use black on white
  if (!csa) csa = 0x0700;
  if (!(c & ~0xFF))
    c |= csa;
  ...
```
In the `printfmt.c`, the following code is changed as following:
```c
void
vprintfmt(void (*putch)(int, void*), void *putdat, const char *fmt, va_list ap)
{
  ...
  while (1) {
    while ((ch = *(unsigned char *) fmt++) != '%') {
      if (ch == '\0') {
        csa = 0x0700; //change color back
        return;
      }
      putch(ch, putdat);
    }
  ...
  switch (ch = *(unsigned char *) fmt++) {
    ...
    case 'm': //change color
      num = getint(&ap, lflag);
      csa = num;
      break;
    ...
    }
  }
}
```
And of course, `csa.h` is included by who need it.

Exercise 9
---
>Q: Determine where the kernel initializes its stack, and exactly where in memory its stack is located. 

In the `entry.S`:
```asm
  # Clear the frame pointer register (EBP)
  # so that once we get into debugging C code,
  # stack backtraces will be terminated properly.
  movl  $0x0,%ebp     # nuke frame pointer

  # Set the stack pointer
  movl  $(bootstacktop),%esp
```
In the `kernel.asm`:
```asm
  # Clear the frame pointer register (EBP)
  # so that once we get into debugging C code,
  # stack backtraces will be terminated properly.
  movl  $0x0,%ebp     # nuke frame pointer
f010002f: bd 00 00 00 00        mov    $0x0,%ebp

  # Set the stack pointer
  movl  $(bootsmdtacktop),%esp
f0100034: bc 00 60 11 f0        mov    $0xf0116000,%esp
```
So the kernel stack starts at `0xf0116000`.

> How does the kernel reserve space for its stack? And at which "end" of this reserved area is the stack pointer initialized to point to?

In the `entry.S`:
```asm
.data
###################################################################
# boot stack
###################################################################
  .p2align  PGSHIFT   # force page alignment
  .globl    bootstack
bootstack:
  .space    KSTKSIZE
  .globl    bootstacktop 
bootstacktop:
```

The difference of `ebp` between the two breakpoints is `0x20`, so every time it pushes 8 4-byte words. They are:
```
return address
saved ebp
saved ebx
abandoned
abandoned
abandoned
abandoned
var x for calling next test_backtrace
```

>Q: Implement the backtrace function as specified above.

```c
int
mon_backtrace(int argc, char **argv, struct Trapframe *tf)
{
  uint32_t* ebp = (uint32_t*) read_ebp();
  cprintf("Stack backtrace:\n");
  while (ebp) {
    cprintf("ebp %x  eip %x  args", ebp, *(ebp+1));
    cprintf(" %x", *(ebp+2));
    cprintf(" %x", *(ebp+3));
    cprintf(" %x", *(ebp+4));
    cprintf(" %x", *(ebp+5));
    cprintf(" %x\n", *(ebp+6));
    ebp = (uint32_t*) *ebp;
  //ebp f0109e58  eip f0100a62  args 00000001 f0109e80 f0109e98 f0100ed2 00000031
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The result is as following:

Exercise 12

So what is `STAB (Symbol TABle)`? I found [this](http://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/stabs_1.html).

Add the following lines to `kdebug.c`:
```c
  stab_binsearch(stabs, &lline, &rline, N_SLINE, addr);
	info->eip_line = stabs[lline].n_desc;
```
Add `backtrace` in `monitor.c`:
```c
int
backtrace(int argc, char **argv, struct Trapframe *tf)
{
  uint32_t* ebp = (uint32_t*) read_ebp();
  cprintf("Stack backtrace:\n");
  while (ebp) {
    uint32_t eip = ebp[1];
    cprintf("ebp %x  eip %x  args", ebp, eip);
    int i;
    for (i = 2; i <= 6; ++i)
      cprintf(" %08.x", ebp[i]);
    cprintf("\n");
    struct Eipdebuginfo info;
    debuginfo_eip(eip, &info);
    cprintf("\t%s:%d: %.*s+%d\n", 
      info.eip_file, info.eip_line,
      info.eip_fn_namelen, info.eip_fn_name,
      eip-info.eip_fn_addr);
//         kern/monitor.c:143: monitor+106
    ebp = (uint32_t*) *ebp;
  }
  return 0;
}

```
and then it works, change the `test_backtrace` in `init.c`:
```c
void
test_backtrace(int x)
{
  cprintf("entering test_backtrace %d\n", x);
  if (x > 0)
    test_backtrace(x-1);
  else
    backtrace(0, 0, 0);
  cprintf("leaving test_backtrace %d\n", x);
}
```
By running the kernel we get:
